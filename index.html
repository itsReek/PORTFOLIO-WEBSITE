      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi! I’m a third-year Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) student specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AIML). I’m passionate about Full Stack Web Development and love solving real-world problems using Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).

Currently, I’m exploring and building my skills in cutting-edge technologies like AI/ML, Cloud Computing, and Blockchain. I enjoy learning, building, and pushing my limits through projects and continuous experimentation.

I’m open to internships, collaborations, and opportunities that help me grow as a developer and contribute meaningfully to the tech world.
